#1. Introduction

####Description of our project - sport_db.Football

Sport is vital part of human society, providing joy, entertainment and health benefits. It is one of the driving force behind our culture. Ball games such as football, baseball, basketball, floorball, etc... are some of the most popular games within its category, with football being the most favored sport in the world. In order to organize and hold these football events or leagues, we need an efficient way to store, process and retrieve information for them as hundreds if not thousands games like these are occurring everyday.

The need for a database serving such purpose is not only for the ease of organizing events, but also for the record. By neatly storing all the events, not only football fans are provided with a mean to easily keep up with the results, but also giving away a mean of analysis for football experts. With such reasons, we decided to create a football database schema, which is generic enough to support storing and processing of all competitive football games.

The existence of SQL (Structured Query Language), a declarative computer language aimed at querying and MySQL relational database, a powerful piece of software optimized for data storage and retrieval, have prompted us to build the football game database utilizing their power. With the popularity of such technologies and the generic property of the project, the resulting product can be extended and put into use universally without much effort and thus can be used for any football league, big or small, on whatever scale it may be.
