#4. Reflection

##4.1. Known problems
The schema is designed for football, and specifically competitive football, and therefore can't really support other sports, also this is not really useful for friendly matches, which occur occasionally around the world. Apart from this, perhaps the schema is very stable and works most of the time.

##4.2. Possible improvements
Possible change to data types can be made to optimize the size of the database, for example, some attributes can be made to use TINYINT or some other INTS which have a more suitable size than BIGINT. However, this may not worth the time and effort considering the simplicity of the schema.

##4.3. Conclusions
The database has been well designed to support a wide range of operations, useful for many purposes, including building an application or website for football news, results, etc... . At the same time, complexity is minimized to keep it easy to maintain and to query information. It's by no mean the most well rounded database which serve all the attributes and properties a football database may need, but it's sufficient and best of all, it just work.
