In the world of competitive football, there are many football games. Each of these games is usually held within a league, which is a large competitive playground where many teams, each with different backgrounds, comprised of different players, will play against each other. Each time a league occurs, it last for a period of time, it is called season, a series of game or match, with each being a competition between two teams. During the ongoing progress of the season, all teams will be ranked, based on their achievements.

When dig deeper, within each team, we have a set of players, they are basically in an employee - company - project relationship. Each player will have their own personal data, same as a team. Scoring is also recorded for each player and team to serve the ranking purpose.

To be more specific, we have players playing for a team and:
+ Each player has an ID, which is the social security number, first name, last name as compulsory info, additional info a player should have is his/her birth date, place of birth, nationality and the specialized position the player play at.
+ A team is defined by an ID, has a regular name and an abbreviated short name, the arena name as their home, the name of the coach and whether or not it's a national team. Abundant info such as city and league can also be added.
+ A team can play in a game (football match) and the match belong to a specific season in a specific league, additional info that may exists is the scores of both teams in the match, along with the points they may earn and the date of the game and the day of the game within the season.
