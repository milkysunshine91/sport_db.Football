In the world of competitive sport, there are many ball game sport. Each of these sports is usually held within a league, which is a large competitive playground where many teams, each with different backgrounds, comprised of different players, will play against each other. Each time a league occur, it last for a period of time, it is called season, a series of game or match, with each is a competition between two teams. During the ongoing progress of the season, all teams will be ranked, based on their achievements.

When dig deeper, within each team, we have a set of players, they are basically in an employee - company - project relationship. Each player will have their own personal data, same as a team. Scoring is also recorded for each player and team to serve the ranking purpose.

To be more specific, we have players playing for a team:

Examples:
1. We store person social security number, full name and date of birth.
2. Project are define by a project number, have a title and a description. They 
also have a specific duration with start and end date.
3. For each project, multiple person can work for or be manager of it. They 
sometimes can be attributed a specific role within the project (e.g. "designer", 
"database architect", "software engineer", etc.). 
4. A person can work for many projects at the same time. We need to know how 
many hours a person works for a specific project.
